??????????
1 variant:product is a child for  stock and  user(manager)
 so polymorphic one to one(

2 variant:
we have  stock   case Main = 'main';
                   case Order = 'order';
                 ???  case Transport = 'transport';
and each manager as stock( after button send has been
 pressed by manager one become responsible for the product)
 So we have 2 basic stock plus number of stocks equal to nember
  of sail managers
  models Stock and User related as one to one
  Stock Product ont to many

----------------
one start page for guest
another for managers
